# Installation/Running my application 

## Prerequisites 

### Docker

This project relies on Docker to run the PostgreSQL server. You must install
Docker first before continuing.

Use one of these methods:

- Use [Homebrew][] on macOS: `brew install --cask docker`
- [Follow the instructions on the Docker website][docker-www]

Once you've installed Docker Desktop, you'll need to launch the app. On macOS,
it's located in `/Applications/Docker`.

### Node

You'll need to install Node v14 or above. [`nvm`][nvm] is highly recommended.

## Set Up the Development Environment

### Install NPM Packages

```sh
npm install
```

## Start the Development Environment

```sh
npm start
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000>.

## Shut Down the Development Environment

1. `Ctrl-C` to stop the Express and React development servers.
1. `npm stop` to stop and destroy the PostgreSQL Docker container. Don't worry,
   your data is safe.
